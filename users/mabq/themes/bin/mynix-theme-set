# - Important!
#   Nix will only override symlinks that point to the nix store.
#   This scripts allows you to quickly set a new theme without having to do
#   a complete nixos rebuild. But when to try a re-build nix will throw an
#   error letting you know that it cannot override a file.
#   You can run `just clean-<host>` to remove manually created symlinks that
#   do not point to the nix store, and then re-try a rebuild.
#   See the `Justfile` at the root of the repository.
