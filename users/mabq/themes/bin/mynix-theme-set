# - Important!
#   Nix only overrides symlinks that point to the nix store.
#   This scripts allows you to quickly set a new theme without having to do a
#   complete nixos rebuild, but keep in mind that Nix will throw an error when
#   attempting a rebuild after using this command cause it won't be able to
#   override the theme symlink created by this script. When that happens run
#   `just clean-<host>` to remove the trouble symlink and then re-try a
#   rebuild. See the `Justfile` at the root of the repository.
