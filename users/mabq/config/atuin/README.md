# Atuin

Atuin is initialized by zsh.

The program works as expected inmediatly, but if you wish to backup your history or sync it with other machines, you need to manually run `atuin login -u <username>`. Look for credentials in password manager.

For more information see; [login](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/sync/#login).
